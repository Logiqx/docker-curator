## xlrd

### Introduction

I'm using xlrd in several projects:

1.2.*

- covid-stats
- wca-db
- scw-comp



Note: xlrd 2.0.0 dropped support for .xlsx files so I may need to consider moving over to openpyxl.



### Latest Version

2.0.1 Dec 11, 2020 - without xlsx support

1.2.0 Dec 15, 2018 - with xlsx support
